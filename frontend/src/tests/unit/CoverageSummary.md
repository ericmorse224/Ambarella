Summary & Recommendations
Strengths:
Most components, hooks, and utility functions have near or full coverage. All major business logic in UI is tested, and most branch/function paths are validated.

Gaps:

App.jsx has some uncovered statements/branches, likely in edge cases or error handling.

Lower branch coverage in AudioUploadForm.jsx, AudioUploader.jsx, and UseMeetingState.jsx — may be from complex conditional logic or rarely hit branches.

ReviewPanel.jsx has function coverage at 66.66% — some handler or callback functions may not be directly tested.

dateUtils.js is missing coverage for some branch logic.

Action Items:

Review and add tests for uncovered lines/branches, especially around error or edge cases.

Increase branch coverage by writing tests for alternate code paths (e.g., failed submissions, validation errors).

Test any "dead code" or legacy code that may not be exercised in current tests.
