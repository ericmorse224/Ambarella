ESLint couldn't find the plugin "${pluginName***REMOVED***".

(The package "${pluginName***REMOVED***" was not found when loaded as a Node module from the directory "${resolvePluginsRelativeTo***REMOVED***".)

It's likely that the plugin isn't installed correctly. Try reinstalling by running the following:

    npm install ${pluginName***REMOVED***@latest --save-dev

The plugin "${pluginName***REMOVED***" was referenced from the config file in "${importerName***REMOVED***".
