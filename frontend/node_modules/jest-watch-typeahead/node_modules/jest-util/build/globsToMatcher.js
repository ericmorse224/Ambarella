 * matchers ahead of time and then have an optimized path for determining
 * whether an individual path matches.
 *
 * This function is intended to match the behavior of `micromatch()`.

 * @example
 * const isMatch = globsToMatcher(['*.js', '!*.test.js']);
 * isMatch('pizza.js'); // true
 * isMatch('pizza.test.js'); // false
